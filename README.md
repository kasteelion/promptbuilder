## How it works

This application is a data-driven prompt-building tool. It uses a set of user-editable markdown files as a database for different prompt components like characters, outfits, scenes, and poses.

The UI allows you to select these components, and the application will assemble them into a final prompt string that you can use with your favorite AI image generator.

## How to use

1.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Check compatibility (optional):**
    ```bash
    python main.py --check-compat
    ```
    This will display your Python version and verify all requirements are met.

3.  **Check version (optional):**
    ```bash
    python main.py --version
    ```

4.  **Select Characters:** Choose from individual character files in the `characters/` folder. Click "**+ Add to Prompt**" to add them to your group.

5.  **Choose Outfits:** Select from shared outfits or character-specific variations. The outfit selector is collapsible for a cleaner interface.

4.  **Build a Scene:** Select different scene elements from `scenes.md`. You can also create new scenes directly in the UI.

5.  **Choose a Pose:** Select a pose from `poses.md` or create custom poses.

6.  **Add Notes:** Include any additional details or modifications in the Notes tab.

7.  **Generate:** The preview panel automatically updates as you make selections, showing the final assembled prompt.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**File Operations:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` - Save current configuration as preset
- `Ctrl+Shift+O` - Load a saved preset

**Editing:**
- `Ctrl+Z` - Undo last action
- `Ctrl+Y` - Redo last undone action

**View:**
- `Ctrl++` or `Ctrl+=` - Increase font size
- `Ctrl+-` - Decrease font size
- `Ctrl+0` - Reset font size to automatic scaling
- `Alt+R` - Randomize all selections

**Preview Panel:**
- `Ctrl+C` - Copy prompt to clipboard
- `Ctrl+S` - Save prompt to file

**Navigation:**
- `Tab` - Navigate between fields
- `Enter` - Add selected character to prompt

### Creating New Content

Use the built-in creator dialogs to add new content:

- **Characters Tab:** "Create New Character" button - includes syntax suggestions based on existing characters
- **Characters Tab:** "Create New Base Style" button - template with 5 standard sections
- **Characters Tab:** "Create New Pose" button - add custom poses
- **Characters Tab → Bulk Outfit Editor:** "Create Shared Outfit" - outfits available to all characters
- **Characters Tab → Individual Character:** "Create Outfit" - character-specific outfit variations
- **Scenes Tab:** "Create New Scene" button - add scenes organized by category

All creator dialogs include copyable help text to assist with proper formatting.

## Data Files

The core of this application is the set of markdown files that it uses as a database. You can edit these files to add, remove, or modify the available options.

### `base_prompts.md`

This file contains base style prompts.

**Format:**

```markdown
## Prompt Name
Prompt content...
---
```

### Characters

Character definitions are stored as individual markdown files in the `characters/` folder. Each character gets its own file for better organization and maintainability.

**File naming:** Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `mela_hart.md`, `nora_alvarez.md`)

**Format:**

```markdown
### Character Name
**Appearance:** description
**Outfits:**

#### Outfit Name
- **Top:** ...
- **Bottom:** ...
- **Footwear:** ...
- **Accessories:** ...
- **Hair/Makeup:** ...
```

**Example structure:**
- `characters/mela_hart.md` - Mela Hart's character definition
- `characters/nora_alvarez.md` - Nora Alvarez's character definition
- etc.

### `outfits.md`

This file contains shared outfit templates that can be used with any character.

**Format:**

```markdown
## Common Outfits
### Outfit Name
Outfit description...

## Character-Specific Variations
### Character Name
#### Outfit Name
Outfit description...
```

**Note:** Character-specific outfits can also be defined within individual character files in the `characters/` folder.

### `poses.md` & `scenes.md`

These files contain presets for poses and scenes, organized by category.

**Format:**

```markdown
## Category Name
- **Item Name:** description
```

## UI Resizing & Display

The application features an intelligent resizing system:

- **Adaptive Font Scaling:** Font size automatically adjusts based on window width using smart breakpoints (9-16pt range)
- **Proportional Panels:** Both the left (controls) and right (preview) panels resize proportionally for balanced viewing
- **Performance Optimized:** Font updates only trigger on significant size changes (50px+) to prevent excessive reconfiguration
- **User Control:** Override automatic scaling with manual font adjustments using keyboard shortcuts or the View menu

The resizing system ensures optimal readability whether you're using the app on a small laptop screen or a large desktop monitor.

## Troubleshooting

### "Python version too old" error

**Problem:** You see an error about Python version being too old.

**Solution:** Upgrade to Python 3.8 or higher:
- Windows: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- macOS: `brew install python@3.12`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3.12` (or use your distro's package manager)

### "tkinter not available" error

**Problem:** Application won't start due to missing tkinter.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tk
```

On Windows/macOS, tkinter should be included with Python. If it's missing, reinstall Python from python.org.

### Character files not loading

**Problem:** Characters aren't showing up in the dropdown.

**Solution:**
1. Check that `.md` files exist in the `characters/` folder
2. Verify file format matches the expected structure (see README)
3. Run `python main.py --check-compat` to verify setup
4. Check console output for parsing errors

### Performance issues (lag during typing)

**Problem:** Application feels slow or laggy.

**Solution:** This has been fixed in the latest version with debouncing. Make sure you're running the latest code. If issues persist:
- Close other applications
- Try a smaller window size
- Check Python version (3.11+ recommended for best performance)

### Unicode/emoji display issues

**Problem:** Emoji characters don't display correctly.

**Solution:** This is typically a font issue. The application uses emojis in buttons and labels:
- Windows: Should work out of the box on Windows 10+
- macOS: Should work out of the box
- Linux: Install a font with emoji support (e.g., `fonts-noto-color-emoji`)

For more detailed compatibility information, see [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Command-Line Options

```bash
python main.py              # Run normally
python main.py --version    # Show version info
python main.py --check-compat  # Check system compatibility
python main.py --debug      # Run in debug mode (shows full error traces)
```
