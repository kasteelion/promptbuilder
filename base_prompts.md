## Cyberpunk Neon

Rendering
High-contrast, dark rendering with a strong focus on neon lighting (rim light and accent colors). Heavy volumetric fog and rain effects for atmosphere. Chromatic aberration and scanline texture for a retro-futuristic digital feel. Synthwave aesthetic, high saturation in lights only.

Character Accuracy
Stylized features with a sharp, angular aesthetic. Stoic or determined expressions appropriate for a dystopian setting. Cybernetic enhancements or techwear detailing are integral to the look. Dynamic, asymmetrical posture.

Body Types
Lean, slightly stylized athletic builds. Emphasis on hard-edged silhouettes and defined musculature or mechanical parts. Body forms defined by strong rim lighting from neon sources.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: High-gloss, often unnatural colors (e.g., electric blue, pink, green), wet-look finish or braided/wired styles. Clothing: Techwear, synthetic fabrics, hardshell armor, and utility straps. Visible seams and integrated LED components.

Details
Integrated holographic displays, circuit board patterns, and Japanese/Kanji lettering as background elements. Accessories are functional tech pieces (data jacks, comms). Gritty, rain-slicked atmosphere.

## Watercolor Impressionistic

Rendering
Soft, translucent rendering that simulates traditional watercolor painting. Visible paper texture and natural bleeding/diffusion of colors. Loose, feathered edges with minimal sharp line work (relying on color washes). Soft, diffused lighting (high-key look).

Character Accuracy
Features are suggested through light and color washes rather than precise lines. Gentle, serene expressions. Focus on the overall mood and color harmony rather than exact photographic likeness. Relaxed, natural posture.

Body Types
Soft, fluid rendering of forms. Body shapes are implied by washes and transitions of color; no hard outlines. Skin tones blend subtly with the background environment.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Rendered as soft, flowing masses of color. Highlights are often achieved by leaving the "paper" white. Clothing: Natural, flowing fabrics (silk, cotton) with folds suggested by changes in color saturation and pooling of pigment.

Details
Minimal, subtle accessories. Color palette is soft, often muted pastels. Atmosphere feels dreamlike, hazy, or like a memory. Background elements are abstract or highly simplified washes of color.

## Low-Poly 3D

Rendering
Stylized Low-Poly 3D model aesthetic. Flat, matte coloring with minimal or no gradients. Hard-edged facet shading where polygons meet. Clean, cartoon-like lighting without realism (ambient occlusion). Minimal texture maps for a clean, blocky look.

Character Accuracy
Simplified, geometric features. Eyes are often simple colored shapes or dots. Expressions are clear and stylized (emoji-like). Focus on clean silhouette and recognizable shapes.

Body Types
Geometric, simplified body forms built from a small number of visible polygons. Proportions are chunky or cartoonishly stylized. No soft curves—all transitions are angular and sharp.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Rendered as solid, angular blocks of color (like stylized helmets). Clothing: Simplified to their essential geometric forms. Folds and details are represented by sharp, angular cuts and color separation, not texture.

Details
Accessories are blocky and geometric. Minimal shadow or stylized cell-shading. Backgrounds are often simple flat colors or geometric landscapes.

## Soft Semi-Realistic: "Quiet Confidence"

Rendering
Soft semi-realistic digital painting with an anamorphic lens flare effect. Key lighting is natural, diffused, and slightly high-key. Color grading is fresh muted florals with a calm tonal balance (analogous color scheme). Finish is matte, with a soft tactile texture; no bloom, glow, or high polish (clear air). Clean tapered linework and gentle volumetric shading.

Character Accuracy
Exact facial likeness and features from reference. Relaxed genuine posture. Warm, quietly confident, approachable expression (genuine smile/soft gaze). Never theatrical or overly stylized.

Body Types
Render accurately and respectfully: soft-curvy, athletic build, natural curves, fuller hips and thighs, lived-in softness, and varied frames. No smoothing or idealizing; bodies are grounded and comfortable. True-to-life skin texture with subtle pores.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: natural weight, smooth strands, gentle S-curve movement, minimal, realistic shine. Clothing: realistic drape with tangible fabric properties (e.g., heavy knit, soft cotton, crisp linen, broken-in leather). Visible stitching and fine wrinkles.

Details
Minimal, understated, correctly scaled jewelry. Light, natural-look makeup (e.g., "no-makeup makeup" look). Harmonious, slightly desaturated colors. Atmosphere is quiet, grounded, sincere (like fresh air).

## Photorealistic: "High-Fidelity Candid"

Rendering
Hyper-photorealistic rendering (8K resolution). Professional portrait photography quality. Natural daylight key lighting with accurate, deep shadow mapping. Shallow depth of field (bokeh), focus on the eyes. Natural color grading (no heavy filters). High-detail fidelity in all textures.

Character Accuracy
Exact photographic likeness with accurate human proportions. Realistic skin texture (visible pores, subtle imperfections, fine lines). Candid, fleeting expression (caught in a natural moment). Authentic body language and posture.

Body Types
True-to-life proportions with natural body diversity. Realistic, functional muscle definition or authentic body composition. Skin shows natural tonal variation, subtle details like freckles, moles, and subtle veins.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Individual strand detail, realistic shine, authentic movement and weight based on style. Clothing: Accurate fabric physics—micro-wrinkles, stretch-marks, and proper weight-based draping. Visible weave (denim/knits) and grain (leather).

Details
Realistic jewelry with proper metallic sheen, reflections, and physical weight. Natural, high-definition makeup application (if present). Environmental lighting interacts naturally with subjects and materials (e.g., subsurface scattering).

## Anime Style: "Dynamic Cel-Shaded"

Rendering
Clean, high-quality Japanese anime illustration style. Hard-edged cel-shading with vibrant, high-saturation colors. Clear separation between base, shadow, and highlight tones. Smooth color gradients only for specific elements (e.g., eye iris). Sharp, energetic line work. Polished digital finish (no texture).

Character Accuracy
Large, expressive anime eyes (detailed catchlights and color gradients). Simplified but recognizable facial features in Manga/Anime convention. Stylized, non-photorealistic proportions. Dynamic, gravity-defying pose with an emphasis on energy and kinesis.

Body Types
Stylized anime proportions (e.g., slender frames, exaggerated muscle). Clear form definition achieved via bold line work and precise shadow placement.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Distinctive anime styling—strong, angular shapes, dramatic, often layered highlights, high-volume/gravity-defying effects. Clothing: Exaggerated folds and motion lines (suggesting speed/wind). Bold, high-contrast color choices.

Details
Intense sparkling/light-bloom effects for eyes and accessories. Simplified graphic jewelry. Background elements: speed lines, tone effects (halftones), or dramatic atmospheric elements (e.g., smoke, stylized electric arcs).
