## Update Approach

### Core Philosophy
Characters are now structured as **modular ingredients** rather than **finished dishes**:
- **Core Features**: Unchangeable physical traits (skin, eyes, body, hair quality)
- **Style Notes**: Preferences that inform outfits (flexible guidelines)
- **Avoid**: Scene/outfit-specific details removed

## Future Character Creation

2. Note **Style Preferences** (flexible guidelines)
3. Avoid **scene/outfit-specific** details
4. Create **character-specific variants** for truly signature elements (like Amira's hijab, Siofra's crown braid, Nora's glasses)

The improved character creator now guides users through this process automatically.
