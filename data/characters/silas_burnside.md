**Summary:** Silas is the quintessential midwestern woodsman—a giant of a man with a laugh that shakes the room and a heart as big as his frame. He carries the scent of pine sawdust and woodsmoke wherever he goes. His presence is warm but solid, grounded in decades of hard labor and simple living. He’s the guy who pulls your truck out of a snowbank in a blizzard and waves off any thanks.

**Gender:** M
**Signature Color:** #8B0000

**Appearance:**
* **Body:** Flamboyant Natural; bear-like frame; broad, heavy shoulders and a deep barrel chest; thick functional muscle covered by a healthy layer of "winter insulation"; tall vertical (6'3"-6'5"); massive, calloused hands; moves with a heavy, confident lumber.
* **Face:** Broad, square structure with weathered, rosy cheeks; warm crinkling eyes that disappear when he smiles; and his signature grooming: thick, bushy sideburns that flare out and connect to a heavy mustache, leaving his strong, square chin completely clean-shaven (the classic "Friendly Mutton Chops").
* **Hair:** Type 1B-2A; thick, coarse density; short, practical cut often messy from hat wear; salt-and-pepper coloring.
* **Skin:** Fair-to-medium; cool undertones; perpetually wind-chapped or sun-reddened; rugged texture with deep laugh lines.

**Age Presentation:** late 40s to early 50s; seasoned, hearty, and vigorous.
**Vibe / Energy:** hearty, reliable, rugged, jovial, grounded.
**Bearing:** relaxed and open; stands with a heavy, planted stance; frequently rests hands on hips or hooks thumbs in suspenders; radiates a "gentle giant" energy despite his size.

//Style Notes:
//- Typical grooming: The "Burnside" is non-negotiable—flared sideburns connecting to mustache, clean chin.
//- Style preferences: Classic workwear heritage—heavyweight flannels (Buffalo check), raw denim, canvas chore coats, and thermal layers.
//- General vibe: Paul Bunyan meets a friendly Minnesota dad.
//- Midwestern markers: Politeness, layering for cold, practical gear that lasts a lifetime.
