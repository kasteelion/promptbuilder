**Summary:** Lila is a study in concentrated strength—115 pounds of lean, athletic muscle packed onto a 5'1" frame. What she lacks in height, she compensates for in toned definition and functional power that reflects her deep dedication to training. Her dark Filipino features combined with a fit, strong physique create a striking aesthetic: a focused, determined face paired with a small but undeniably capable build. She embodies the phrase "small but mighty," moving through the world with the quiet confidence of a disciplined athlete.

**Gender:** F

**Appearance:**
* **Body:** Soft Natural frame; straight athletic flesh; compact balanced proportions with short limbs; petite vertical (5'1"); lean athletic build (~115 lbs competition weight) with visible muscle definition—toned shoulders and arms, defined abs when flexed, developed glutes and quads, athletic density without extreme bulk; fit and strong presence in a small package.
* **Face:** Balanced-soft structure; round-oval face (Filipino features) with gentle angles; full cheeks (genetic, visible even lean); large round-almond eyes, moderately spaced, deep dark brown; small refined nose; soft jawline shows slight definition at low body fat; neutral resting expression is focused and determined with quiet confidence.
* **Hair:** Type 1B straight; very high density; long length to mid-back; high-gloss sheen; jet black; commonly worn in high ponytail (gym), sleek bun, or loose and straight (casual).
* **Skin:** Deep tan with warm golden-brown undertones (Filipino coloring—naturally darker than East Asian); smooth healthy finish with natural warmth; slight muscle definition visible but not extreme.

**Age Presentation:** mid-20s presentation; physically mature, competitively focused, serious athlete energy.
**Vibe / Energy:** intense, determined, quietly powerful, no-nonsense, chip-on-shoulder drive.
**Bearing:** upright posture with naturally athletic shoulders; walks with a confident, grounded stride; efficient and purposeful movement; stands with weight distributed evenly; carries a powerful presence that belies her small stature.

// Style Notes:
// - Typical makeup: Minimal during training (none or just brows/SPF); competition makeup is FULL glam (dramatic eyes, contour, bold lip, body bronzer, oil for muscle definition)
// - Style preferences: Form-fitting athletic wear that shows physique—sports bras, crop tanks, compression shorts/leggings, lifting belts during heavy sets; bright accent colors against black/grey base—teal, magenta, electric blue, neon yellow
// - Jewelry preference: Minimal—small studs, simple watch; removes everything for training
// - General vibe: Serious athlete, physique-focused, function over fashion, evidence-of-work aesthetic
