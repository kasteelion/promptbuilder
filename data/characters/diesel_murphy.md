**Summary:** Diesel lives with wrench in hand and grease under her nails. Her butch presentation is authentic feminine masculinity—she's unmistakably a woman who simply expresses herself through masculine aesthetics and body language. In male-dominated garage spaces, she commands respect through skill and quiet confidence rather than trying to be "one of the guys." Vintage cars are her language of love and precision, and she speaks it fluently with calloused hands and an encyclopedic knowledge of carburetors.

**Gender:** F

**Appearance:**

* **Body:** Natural frame; straight athletic flesh with functional density; balanced proportions with broadened shoulders from upper body work, minimal waist definition, and straight hip line; moderate-to-tall vertical (5'7"-5'8"); working-class athletic build with developed forearms and shoulders from mechanical work, strong hands, visible core strength, practical muscle without aesthetic focus; distinctly female frame with masculine presentation and movement patterns; grounded capable presence.

* **Face:** Balanced-angular structure; square-to-rectangular face shape with broad forehead and strong defined jawline; minimal midface projection with subtle cheekbones; medium-to-small eyes with moderate-close spacing, hazel-brown color, minimal lid exposure, direct no-nonsense gaze; straight broad nose with flat bridge and squared tip; strong angular jawline with masculine definition; neutral resting expression shows calm confidence with closed-mouth straight line and steady assessing gaze; rare smile is crooked and genuine.

* **Hair:** Type 2A; medium density; very short length (pixie-to-undercut style); no defined part, textured and pushed back; matte finish; commonly worn tousled and practical, sometimes with small amount of pomade for control; dark brown with sun-lightened tips from outdoor work.

* **Skin:** Light-medium tone with neutral-warm undertones and natural matte finish; scattered scars on hands and forearms from mechanical work; permanent grease staining under short fingernails and in hand creases; sun exposure on forearms and face; textured from outdoor work.

**Age Presentation:** late 20s to early 30s presentation; working-class confidence, practical maturity, grounded self-knowledge.

**Vibe / Energy:** confident, capable, straightforward, no-bullshit, quietly commanding.

**Bearing:** wide stable stance with weight evenly distributed; practical economical movement; hands often in pockets or hooked in belt loops; relaxed shoulders with capable readiness; direct eye contact; tendency to lean against walls or vehicles; consciously adopted masculine body language that feels natural to her as a butch woman; moves through space claiming room without apology.

//Style Notes:
//- Typical makeup: none
//- Style preferences: masculine workwear—denim, flannel, work pants, steel-toe boots in blacks, grays, navy, olive
//- Jewelry preference: minimal to none—maybe simple leather band or steel ring, no decorative pieces
//- General vibe: working-class butch lesbian, practical masculine presentation as authentic self-expression, vintage car culture, confident in traditionally male spaces
//- IMPORTANT: Diesel is a masculine-presenting woman, NOT male-passing; she's clearly female with deliberately masculine aesthetic choices
//- Mechanic identity: permanently grease-stained, calloused hands, motor oil scent, vintage band tees under flannel
//- Signature elements: steel-toe boots always, worn-in jeans, flannel shirts (sleeves rolled to show forearms), work gloves hanging from back pocket, grease rag
//- Vintage car culture: classic rock aesthetic, hot rod references, knows every engine sound, car show regular
//- Butch lesbian identity markers: intentional masculine presentation, carabiner on belt loop, short practical nails, confident claiming of space, part of visible queer community
//- Physical tells of femaleness: hip structure visible even in loose pants, chest binding not present (small chest, sports bra suffices), hand size proportional to female frame, facial structure clearly female despite angular features
//- Color palette: navy blue, charcoal gray, black, olive green, rust orange (vintage car colors)
//- Always carries: multi-tool, shop rag, car keys on carabiner
//- Practical modifications: reinforced work pants, doubled fabric at knees, pockets everywhere
