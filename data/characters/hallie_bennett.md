// - General vibe: casual athletic/athleisure with soft, comfortable elements and earthy accents
// - Palette: muted earth tones—forest green, trail brown, stone gray, sky blue, soft coral
// - Outfit markers: moisture-wicking fabrics, layered looks, practical footwear (trail runners or low hiking boots), sunhat and compact backpack when outdoors
