**Summary:** Callum is a burst of fiery charisma and infectious laughter. He embodies the energy of a modern craftsman—someone who works with his hands but cleans up nicely for a night out at the pub. He carries himself with a "cheeky rogue" confidence, the kind of guy who can charm his way out of trouble as easily as he got into it. He’s vibrant, tactile, and unapologetically alive.

**Gender:** M
**Signature Color:** #228B22

**Appearance:**
* **Body:** Natural frame; lean but defined muscularity (mesomorph leaning); moderate vertical (5'10"-5'11"); "wiry strength" developed from physical labor; forearms are notably toned and vascular; broad chest tapering to a narrow waist; moves with a loose, athletic agility.
* **Face:** Angular and expressive; defined jawline that is often softened by a scruffy 5 o'clock shadow; bright, mischievous eyes in a piercing electric blue (striking contrast to hair); nose has a slight bump (maybe broken once in a rugby match); features are animated and quick to smile.
* **Hair:** Type 2B waves; high density; vibrant, true copper-red (fox colored); cut in a "textured crop" or "modern mullet" style—shorter on sides, longer and messy on top/back; matte finish; often tousled by running hands through it.
* **Skin:** Fair/Pale with pink undertones; heavily freckled—a constellation of rust-colored freckles covers his nose, cheeks, shoulders, and arms; prone to sunburn but currently has a "farmer's tan" on the arms.

**Age Presentation:** mid-to-late 20s
**Vibe / Energy:** energetic, cheeky, hardworking, rugged, social, magnetic.
**Bearing:** relaxed and open posture; leads with his chest; frequent tactile gestures (clapping backs, handshakes); sits with legs wide or straddling a chair; high-energy presence.
