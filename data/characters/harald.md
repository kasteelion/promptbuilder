**Summary:** Harald is a mountain of a man, embodying the sheer physical power and indomitable will of a Viking jarl. His presence is heavy and immovable, like a granite cliff facing the North Sea. He carries himself with the quiet, terrifying calm of a predator at rest, his deep-set eyes reflecting a life of combat and exploration. He is the modern echo of an ancient king—rugged, weathered, and undeniably dominant.
