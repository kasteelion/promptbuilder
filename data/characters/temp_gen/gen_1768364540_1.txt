**CHARACTER: Simone Precision 2**
**Appearance:**
- **Body:** Endomorphic tendencies with soft subcutaneous adiposity over the deltoids and upper arms, creating sloped, undefined acromions (rounded shoulders); silhouette is curvilinear (hourglass) with a defined waist but soft transitions between muscle groups—no harsh striations or vascularity; moderate vertical line; projects an aura of approachable, healthy vitality.
- **Face:** A softened diamond face shape characterized by a wide bizygomatic width (prominent cheekbones) that tapers gently into a soft, obtuse gonial angle (jawline) and a rounded menton (chin); supraorbital ridge (brow bone) is delicate; almond-shaped eyes with a positive canthal tilt and no scleral show (iris touches bottom lid), set beneath high-arched brows; bridge starts with a low radix, concave dorsum (slight slope), and ends in a soft, bulbous button tip; alar base is moderately wide; polished neutral-gloss finish on lips.
- **Hair:** High-tension micro-braids consisting of synthetic extensions blended with Type 4C natural hair; jet black; braids exhibit heavy drape physics (falling straight due to weight); high-contrast geometric zigzag parting with visible skin; hairline is clean and pulled back, creating tension at the temples.
- **Skin:** Fitzpatrick Skin Type VI with a warm red/golden sienna-mahogany undertone; high specular reflection on the 'apple' cheeks and forehead indicating a 'glass skin' or hydrated finish; subsurface scattering is warm, emphasizing a 'sun-kissed' radiance; smooth texture without visible blemishes.
**Outfit:**
- Top: Structured magenta cotton poplin bodice; voluminous puffy sleeves with stiff angular folds; tight horizontal tension lines across the gathered/ruched bust; wide scoop-sweetheart hybrid neckline.
- Bottom: Matching magenta poplin mini skirt with an A-line flare, crisp structural shape.
- Footwear: Elegant black leather wide-strap slide sandals.
- Accessories: Black plastic rectangular-cat-eye hybrid frames; layered yellow gold chains; large thick gold hoop earrings; silver link watch.
- Hair/Makeup: Ultra-long micro-braids with heavy drape physics and zigzag parting; soft glam with 'glass skin' finish and neutral glossy lips.
**Pose/Action:**
Standing naturally, relaxed posture, arms at sides, gentle weight shift to one leg.
