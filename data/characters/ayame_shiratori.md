### Ayame Shiratori

**Summary:** They see the blue eyes first—then they see the damage she can do. Ayame earned her nickname the hard way, building a reputation in underground fighting circuits where her striking appearance became synonymous with swift, technical brutality. She moves with the controlled economy of a martial artist, every gesture purposeful, every stance grounded. The blue eyes aren't for Instagram—they're the last thing her opponents see before the lights go out.
