# Prompt Builder - Python Package Requirements
# This application uses only Python standard library modules
# No external dependencies required!

# Python version requirement
# python_requires = ">=3.8"

# Optional: For development/testing
# The following packages are NOT required to run the application
# but can be useful for development:

# pytest>=7.0.0          # For running tests (if you add them)
# black>=22.0.0          # For code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0          # For linting
# mypy>=0.950            # For type checking

# Note: This application intentionally uses only standard library
# to maximize compatibility and minimize installation complexity.
# tkinter is part of the standard library but may need separate
# installation on some Linux distributions.
