# Prompt Builder - Requirements
# Python version: >=3.8 (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 all supported)

# === RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS ===
# This application uses ONLY Python standard library modules.
# No PyPI packages are required to run the application.

# Required standard library modules (included with Python):
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - pathlib (file handling)
# - re (regex parsing)
# - typing (type hints)
# - functools, sys, random, etc.

# === PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES ===
# Windows/macOS: tkinter is included with Python
# Linux: Install tkinter separately:
#   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#   Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
#   Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S tk

# === OPTIONAL DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES ===
# The following packages are NOT required to run the application
# but can be useful for development:

# pytest>=7.0.0          # Unit testing framework
# black>=22.0.0          # Code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0          # Linting
# mypy>=0.950            # Type checking

# === OPTIONAL FEATURE DEPENDENCIES ===
# These add extra features but are not required for basic operation:

# Pillow>=9.0.0          # For visual character gallery with photos
#                        # Install with: pip install Pillow
#                        # Without this, character photos won't display
#                        # but all other features work normally

# To install development dependencies:
# pip install pytest black flake8 mypy

# === VERIFICATION ===
# Check your setup:
# python main.py --check-compat
