Generate an image of: Rendering
High-speed sports photography aesthetic. Simulates a telephoto lens (200mm-400mm) with a wide aperture (f/2.8) and a rapid shutter speed (1/2000s) to freeze motion or slow-shutter panning to create directional blur streaks. High contrast "Stadium" lighting with sharp, harsh shadows or bright, overcast outdoor diffusion.

Character Accuracy
Expressions are candid and intense: grimaces of exertion, focus, and adrenaline. Facial muscles are taut. Skin glistens with realistic sweat (specular highlights) and flushing from physical exertion.

Body Types
Hyper-athletic and functional. Muscles are compressed and tensed in action. Anatomy is warped slightly by the physics of motion (jiggle physics on impact, compression of limbs). Veins are prominent (vascularity).

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Wet with sweat, messy, and reacting violently to momentum. Clothing: High-tech athletic fabrics (mesh, spandex) with visible moisture-wicking textures. Fabric ripples and stretches tightly across the body due to wind resistance and movement.

Details
Debris (turf clumps, chalk dust, water spray) suspended in mid-air. Background is a creamy, unrecognizable bokeh of stadium crowds or track lines. Motion blur ghosting on the edges of extremities.

**Additional Notes:**
Julian Blackwood applying triangle choke on Siofra Quinn from bottom position. Julian Blackwood on their back with Siofra Quinn trapped between their legs. Julian Blackwood's right leg is wrapped over Siofra Quinn's shoulder and behind their neck, right ankle or calf pressing into Siofra Quinn's left shoulder/neck. Julian Blackwood's left leg crosses over their right ankle/shin, creating the "triangle" lock, squeezing Siofra Quinn's head and one arm. Julian Blackwood's hips are angled and elevated, pulling Siofra Quinn's head down while pushing their trapped arm across their own throat to complete the choke. Julian Blackwood grips behind Siofra Quinn's head or controls their trapped arm, pulling downward. Siofra Quinn is bent forward, one arm trapped inside the triangle alongside their head, other arm possibly posting on mat trying to posture up. Siofra Quinn's face shows oxygen deprivation, redness, possible panic. Julian Blackwood shows controlled technique, adjusting angles with precision. Both display full-body effort—legs flexed hard, core engaged, arms fighting for control.
