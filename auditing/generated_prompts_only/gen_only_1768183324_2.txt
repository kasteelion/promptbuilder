Generate an image of: Rendering
Flat-shaded retro 3D render engine style (reminiscent of PS1/N64). No smoothing groups; visible polygon triangulation. Lighting is baked-in vertex coloring or simple gouraud shading. vibrant, matte colors with zero surface texture (no noise or grain).

Character Accuracy
Facial features are reduced to minimum geometry. Eyes are texture-mapped stickers or simple geometric planes. Expressions are exaggerated and iconic to compensate for lack of detail.

Body Types
Blocky, chunky proportions. Hands are "mitten" style or simple blocks. Limbs are cylinders or cuboids with visible joints. The silhouette is jagged and distinctly digital.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Solid "helmet" meshes with sharp spikes or blocky forms. Clothing: Painted directly onto the mesh topology. Folds are represented by sharp triangular color changes rather than geometry.

Details
Floating geometry items. distinct "aliasing" or jagged pixel edges. Shadows are simple drop-shadow circles. Backgrounds use solid distinct colors or gradients to make the model pop.
