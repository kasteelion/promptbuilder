Generate an image of: Rendering
High-speed sports photography aesthetic. Simulates a telephoto lens (200mm-400mm) with a wide aperture (f/2.8) and a rapid shutter speed (1/2000s) to freeze motion or slow-shutter panning to create directional blur streaks. High contrast "Stadium" lighting with sharp, harsh shadows or bright, overcast outdoor diffusion.

Character Accuracy
Expressions are candid and intense: grimaces of exertion, focus, and adrenaline. Facial muscles are taut. Skin glistens with realistic sweat (specular highlights) and flushing from physical exertion.

Body Types
Hyper-athletic and functional. Muscles are compressed and tensed in action. Anatomy is warped slightly by the physics of motion (jiggle physics on impact, compression of limbs). Veins are prominent (vascularity).

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Wet with sweat, messy, and reacting violently to momentum. Clothing: High-tech athletic fabrics (mesh, spandex) with visible moisture-wicking textures. Fabric ripples and stretches tightly across the body due to wind resistance and movement.

Details
Debris (turf clumps, chalk dust, water spray) suspended in mid-air. Background is a creamy, unrecognizable bokeh of stadium crowds or track lines. Motion blur ghosting on the edges of extremities.

**Additional Notes:**
Dim, gritty grappling moment. Enzo Rossi is on their back in half guard, left leg bent with knee up, right leg hooking and trapping Kassandra Lykaios's left thigh, preventing the pass. Kassandra Lykaios is on top with their left leg trapped, right leg posted wide for base. Kassandra Lykaios applies a heavy cross-face with their right forearm pressing across Enzo Rossi's jaw and neck, driving weight through shoulder into face. Their hips are low and heavy, chest pressure smothering. Knees frame the position with right knee tight to Enzo Rossi's hip. Their left arm underhooks Enzo Rossi's right arm to stabilize and prevent escape, hand gripping behind the back or shoulder. Right hand is free, threatening short ground-and-pound strikes to the body or head. The alignment is clean—both fighters face each other from a realistic top half-guard position. Enzo Rossi's left arm frames against Kassandra Lykaios's neck or shoulder, creating defensive space. Both show muscle definition and tension, particularly in shoulders, arms, and core. Expressions show exertion: gritted teeth, strained faces, sweat visible.
