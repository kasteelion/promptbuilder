Generate an image of: Rendering
Wet-on-wet traditional watercolor simulation. Pigment pooling, paper grain texture, and natural capillary bleeding edges. High-key lighting with white paper negative space used for highlights. Colors are transparent and layered, lacking harsh black outlines.

Character Accuracy
Facial features are suggested through shadow shapes and color temperature shifts rather than line art. Eyes and expressions are soft and diffused. Likeness is captured through "gestural" paint application rather than photographic precision.

Body Types
Figures are grounded in gesture drawing techniques. Limbs and torso shapes are defined by broad washes of color. Edges of the body dissolve softly into the background, creating a dreamy, ethereal connection to the environment.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Rendered as loose, flowing pools of color with wet edges. Clothing: Fabrics are depicted through variegation in color saturation. Folds are soft gradients where paint creates "blooms." No sharp stitching or texture detailing.

Details
Splatter droplets, dry-brush scratch marks, and visible pencil under-drawing. The palette is harmonious and desaturated. Backgrounds are abstract washes suggesting environment without explicit detail.
