Generate an image of: Rendering
Flat-shaded retro 3D render engine style (reminiscent of PS1/N64). No smoothing groups; visible polygon triangulation. Lighting is baked-in vertex coloring or simple gouraud shading. vibrant, matte colors with zero surface texture (no noise or grain).

Character Accuracy
Facial features are reduced to minimum geometry. Eyes are texture-mapped stickers or simple geometric planes. Expressions are exaggerated and iconic to compensate for lack of detail.

Body Types
Blocky, chunky proportions. Hands are "mitten" style or simple blocks. Limbs are cylinders or cuboids with visible joints. The silhouette is jagged and distinctly digital.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Solid "helmet" meshes with sharp spikes or blocky forms. Clothing: Painted directly onto the mesh topology. Folds are represented by sharp triangular color changes rather than geometry.

Details
Floating geometry items. distinct "aliasing" or jagged pixel edges. Shadows are simple drop-shadow circles. Backgrounds use solid distinct colors or gradients to make the model pop.

**Additional Notes:**
Ines Santos and Julian Blackwood standing face-to-face in dramatic promotional poster composition, positioned at center frame. Both in fighting stance but staged for camera—bodies angled 30-degrees toward each other, shoulders square to viewer. Faces are close, approximately 12-18 inches apart, eyes locked in intense stare-down. Chins slightly lowered, jaws clenched, expressions fierce and determined. Fists raised between them at chest/face height in guard position, knuckles nearly touching. Dramatic lighting from above and sides creating strong shadows and highlights on facial features and muscle definition. Background can be dark, smoky, or gradient. Both fighters mental intensity. Optional: flames, arena lights, or promotional graphics in background. Stance is powerful and symmetrical, weight evenly distributed, projecting equal threat and confidence.
