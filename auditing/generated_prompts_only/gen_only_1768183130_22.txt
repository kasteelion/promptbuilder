Generate an image of: Rendering
High-resolution vector-style illustration. Sharp, non-aliased distinct line art. Coloring uses "hard shading" (clear separation between light and dark) with minimal gradients. Colors are highly saturated and distinct.

Character Accuracy
Stylized facial proportions: large eyes, simplified noses/mouths. Chin and jawlines are sharp and angular. Expressions are clearly readable and slightly exaggerated for emotional clarity.

Body Types
Idealized anime anatomy. Elongated limbs and exaggerated posture. Anatomy is simplified into aesthetically pleasing shapes rather than biological realism.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Gravity-defying clumps with distinct "shiny" highlight bands. Clothing: Folds are sharp, triangular, and dramatic. Fabric behaves dynamically to emphasize motion lines.

Details
"Screen tone" dots for shading texture. Speed lines or radial focus lines in the background. Lens flare is stylized (starbursts). Pop-art color palettes.
