Generate an image of: Rendering
Monochromatic graphite or charcoal aesthetic. White or off-white paper background. Lines vary frantically in weight and opacity. Visible "construction lines" and erasure marks left in the final image to show the process.

Character Accuracy
Focus on the "essence" of the face. Features may be loosely defined or merely suggested. Eyes are focal points with higher detail, while peripheral features fade into rough sketches.

Body Types
Gestural anatomy. The figure is defined by action lines and rhythm. Joints and muscles are marked with quick, scribbled notation. The body often fades into non-existence at the edges.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Rapid, sweeping strokes showing direction. Clothing: Outlines only, with cross-hatching used for shadow density. Folds are indicated by quick, zigzagging lines.

Details
Smudge marks, graphite dust, and handwritten artistic notes. The lighting is purely suggested by the density of the hatch marks.
