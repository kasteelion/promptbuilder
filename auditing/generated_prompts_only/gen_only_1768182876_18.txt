1990s TV animation aesthetic. Flat colors with very simple two-tone shading (highlight and shadow). Line work is standard uniform width. Colors are slightly muted or "faded" to simulate analog broadcast.

Character Accuracy
Standardized facial proportions. Eyes are large but not excessive. Features are balanced and friendly. Expressions are readable standard archetypes.

Body Types
Average, relatable anatomy. Not overly muscular or overly slender. Poses are static or "keyframe" style.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Solid blocks of color with simple white zigzag highlights. Clothing: everyday casual or uniform. Folds are minimal and functional.

Details
Hand-painted watercolor style backgrounds (static). Minimal visual effects—no bloom or complex lighting. The image looks like a screen capture from a CRT television.
