Standardized facial proportions. Eyes are large but not excessive. Features are balanced and friendly. Expressions are readable standard archetypes.

Body Types
Average, relatable anatomy. Not overly muscular or overly slender. Poses are static or "keyframe" style.

Hair & Clothing
Hair: Solid blocks of color with simple white zigzag highlights. Clothing: everyday casual or uniform. Folds are minimal and functional.

Details
Hand-painted watercolor style backgrounds (static). Minimal visual effects—no bloom or complex lighting. The image looks like a screen capture from a CRT television.

**Additional Notes:**
Callum Doherty and Leilani Te'o in coordinated stylish outfits striking confident poses. Both in fashion-forward stance showing personality and style. Callum Doherty might stand with hand on hip, leg crossed in front, chin lifted confidently. Leilani Te'o mirrors or complements with own pose—arms crossed, leaning slightly, or dynamic stance. Outfits coordinated by color palette or aesthetic—matching colors, complementary styles, or themed fashion (all black, monochrome, matching prints). Hair styled intentionally, makeup bold and camera-ready. Accessories coordinated—sunglasses, bags, jewelry. Body language exudes confidence—shoulders back, posture straight, expressions serious and smoldering or playfully confident. Eye contact with camera, commanding attention. Background minimal or aesthetic—urban setting, clean wall, architectural elements. Lighting professional-quality or golden hour. Composition treats subjects as fashion models. Energy is aspirational, polished, and influential—content that others want to recreate.
