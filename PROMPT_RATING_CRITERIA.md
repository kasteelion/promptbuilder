# Prompt Rating Criteria

Use this guide to evaluate the quality of generated prompts.

## 1. Visual Coherence (1-5)
*Does the prompt describe a visually logical image?*
- **5 (Excellent):** Characters, outfits, and setting blend perfectly (e.g., Athletes in a gym wearing sportswear).
- **3 (Average):** Minor clashes (e.g., A character in a suit at the beach, but it could be a fashion shoot).
- **1 (Poor):** Complete nonsense (e.g., Lying on satin sheets in the middle of a busy airport).

## 2. Character Integrity (1-5)
*Do the characters look and act like themselves?*
- **5 (Excellent):** Physical descriptions, outfits, and poses match the character's defined personality and style.
- **3 (Average):** Generic descriptions that could apply to anyone.
- **1 (Poor):** Contradictory descriptions (e.g., A shy character doing an aggressive, flamboyant pose without context).

## 3. Thematic Consistency (1-5)
*do the art style, lighting, and mood align?*
- **5 (Excellent):** "Noir" style prompt has shadowy lighting, detectives, and rainy streets.
- **3 (Average):** Style is present but generic.
- **1 (Poor):** Clashing themes (e.g., "Cyberpunk" art style for a "Cottagecore" picnic scene).

## 4. Interaction Quality (1-5) (If applicable)
*Does the interaction make sense for the characters involved?*
- **5 (Excellent):** Dynamic, physically grounded interaction (e.g., "High-five," "Passing a baton").
- **3 (Average):** Generic "Standing together."
- **1 (Poor):** Physically impossible or clipping (e.g., "Both occupying the exact same space").

## 5. Technical Formatting (Pass/Fail)
- **Pass:** No unresolved placeholders (`{team}`, `{color}`). proper Markdown formatting.
- **Fail:** Broken tags, code leaks, or empty sections.

## Common Issues to Watch For
- **"Bed Sheets in Public":** Characters lying on beds/sheets in inappropriate public settings (Airports, Gyms).
- **"Formal Gym Goer":** Characters wearing tuxedos/gowns in athletic settings.
- **"Clone Wars":** Characters accidentally identical due to limited outfit pools (unless intended team uniforms).
